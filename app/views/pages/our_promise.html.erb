<%= title('Our Promise') %>

<h3>We will always be transparent.</h3>
<p>Medical research is a risky endeavor and among the thousands of discoveries, only a handful of them will result in patient treatments.</p>

<h3>We will always keep you informed.</h3>
<p>Whether or not the research you help fund is successful, we will keep you updated on what worked, what didnâ€™t work and how the research will help inform future studies and increase their chance of success.</p>

<h3>We will always refund your donation.</h3>
<p>If the fundraising goal is not met, the researcher still receives the funds and may pursue other avenues for the remaining amount. However, you can always request a refund within 30 days of the campaign end date.</p>
